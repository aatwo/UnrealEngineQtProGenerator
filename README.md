# UnrealEngineQtProGenerator

<b>What is this?</b> When you create a new Unreal Engine project on Windows it automatically generates the visual studio project files for you. This tool uses these to generate Qt pro files so your Unreal Engine project can be opened and run using Qt Creator.

<b>Why the heck would you want to do this?</b> 
Well to be honest you probably wouldn't, but if you're like me and prefer Qt Creator to Visual Studio then this is the project for you!

<b>How do I use this?</b> Just build it using Qt Creator on Windows, run it and follow the instructions.
