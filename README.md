# UnrealEngineQtProGenerator

<b>What is this?</b> This tool helps you generate Qt project files on Windows for your Unreal Engine C++ projects, allowing you to open, run, build and debug your projects using Qt Creator.

<b>Why the heck would you want to do this?</b> 
Well to be honest you probably wouldn't, but if you're like me and prefer Qt Creator to Visual Studio then this is the project for you!

<b>How do I use this?</b> Just build it using Qt Creator on Windows, run it and follow the instructions.

<b>Disclaimer</b> I intend to maintain this project but only enough to keep it alive. It was just a quick and dirty tool to make setting up my new Unreal Engine projects a bit quicker.

<b>What versions does this support?</b> This has only been tested using Qt 5.10, Visual Studio 2017 and Unreal Engine 4.17.2.
